# intl

A tool to generate internationalization (i18n) code using the JavaScript Intl API.


## Usage

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is required. Clone the repository then run in development mode:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Source files in `src` are built to the `build` folder.

Open `localhost:3000` in a browser for live code editing and updates.


## Build production code

Code can be minified for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Code in the `build` directory can be copied to any web server.
